                  <p><span>Identity Design:</span> I take care of all visual aspects that make up your brand including colour, typography, patterns, imagery and logos delivered in a complete Brand Style Guide.</p>
                  <p><span>Web Design:</span> I start with user experience design determining user personas and user flow then building sitemaps and wireframes before moving on to interface design, incorporating your brand's look and feel.

                  <p><span>Hand-Coded HTML:</span> I write the code based on the final web design with a focus on clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5. This ensures your web content is accessible and simple to expand upon.
                    </p>
                  <p><span>Well-Organized &amp; Responsive CSS:</span> Working as your designer &amp; developer means I can ensure the final website is a pixel perfect match to the design and do so with CSS that is not only mobile responsive but also easy to read and build on.</p>

                <h4>Textiles, Interiors</h4>
                <p>My career started in textile sales &amp; interior design where I was so inspired by the colour combinations and sophisticated patterns in high end fabrics. I loved building colour palettes, mixing materials and sketching floor plans.</p>
                <h4>Data Analysis, Visualizations</h4>
                <p>My logical and practical self pulled me in a technical direction to the communications industry where I worked in data and business analytics however I still felt an urge for a creative outlet. I discovered how to present my work in meaningful ways by telling a story with data visualizations.</p>

              <div class="right-side">
                <h4>Web Design, Development</h4>
                <p>Then I discovered web design &amp; coding. In the past, I always felt like I was either pushed too far into a creative field or pulled too far into a technical direction, but the combination of visual design and web development seems to be the perfect balance of art and science.</p>
                <h4>Let's work together</h4>
                <p>Now, I feel so lucky to be able to do what I do. I'm passionate about creating beautiful, online spaces and always try to create something unique and personal for my clients. I'd love to do the same for you!</p>
